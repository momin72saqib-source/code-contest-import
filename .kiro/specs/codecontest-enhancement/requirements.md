# CodeContest Pro Enhancement - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for enhancing the CodeContest Pro platform with comprehensive functionality including a complete problem database, real solution verification, plagiarism detection, activity logging, and real-time features while preserving the existing UI structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Problem Database Population

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to populate the platform with approximately 200 data structure problems across various categories, so that students have a comprehensive set of problems to practice and compete with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN populating the database THEN the system SHALL include problems covering arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hashing, and dynamic programming
2. WHEN creating each problem THEN the system SHALL include title, description, input/output format, constraints, public test cases, hidden test cases, difficulty level, and tags
3. WHEN sourcing problems THEN the system SHALL only use problems from educational and open-access repositories with permissive licenses
4. WHEN storing problems THEN the system SHALL save them in the `problems` collection with proper structure
5. WHEN linking problems THEN the system SHALL associate problems with contests appropriately

### Requirement 2: Real Solution Verification

**User Story:** As a student, I want my code submissions to be automatically verified against test cases with real execution, so that I can receive accurate feedback on my solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student submits code THEN the system SHALL store the submission in the `submissions` collection with userID, problemID, contestID, language, code, and timestamp
2. WHEN processing submissions THEN the system SHALL use Judge0 API or similar service to execute code against all test cases
3. WHEN execution completes THEN the system SHALL store results including passed/failed test cases, execution time, memory usage, and any errors
4. WHEN evaluating submissions THEN the system SHALL mark submission as acceptable only if all test cases pass
5. WHEN submissions are processed THEN the system SHALL update contest leaderboards in real-time using WebSockets

### Requirement 3: Submission Management System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view submission details and results, so that I can track my progress and understand my performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN students view submissions THEN the system SHALL show their own submissions with pass/fail results, execution metadata, and plagiarism results
2. WHEN hosts view submissions THEN the system SHALL show all submissions for contests they manage
3. WHEN submission results change THEN the system SHALL update displays in real-time via WebSockets
4. WHEN displaying submissions THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive execution details and error information

### Requirement 4: Plagiarism Detection Integration

**User Story:** As a contest host, I want automatic plagiarism detection on submissions, so that I can maintain academic integrity in competitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a submission is made THEN the system SHALL trigger JPlag API for plagiarism analysis
2. WHEN plagiarism analysis completes THEN the system SHALL store results including similarity scores and matched submissions
3. WHEN plagiarism is detected THEN the system SHALL notify both host and student
4. WHEN JPlag API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use fallback plagiarism detection methods
5. WHEN storing plagiarism results THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed similarity analysis data

### Requirement 5: Activity Logging System

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive activity logging, so that I can track all user actions and system events for auditing and analytics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users perform actions THEN the system SHALL log all host/student actions in the `activityLogs` collection
2. WHEN logging activities THEN the system SHALL include contest/problem creation, joining, submission creation, and plagiarism alerts
3. WHEN activities occur THEN the system SHALL reflect updates in real-time for relevant users using WebSockets
4. WHEN storing logs THEN the system SHALL include timestamps, user information, action types, and relevant metadata

### Requirement 6: Secure Authentication System

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure authentication and session management, so that my account and data are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users register THEN the system SHALL store email as unique identifier and hash passwords using bcrypt
2. WHEN users login THEN the system SHALL verify credentials by comparing hashed passwords
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL issue JWT tokens for secure sessions
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL verify JWT tokens for all subsequent authenticated requests
5. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication

### Requirement 7: Real-time Updates and WebSocket Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates for leaderboards, submissions, and notifications, so that I have immediate feedback and current information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN leaderboards change THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates via WebSockets to all connected clients
2. WHEN submissions are processed THEN the system SHALL send real-time updates to relevant users
3. WHEN plagiarism alerts occur THEN the system SHALL notify affected users immediately
4. WHEN activity logs are created THEN the system SHALL update relevant dashboards in real-time

### Requirement 8: Enhanced Platform Features

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want additional features like bulk import and pagination, so that I can efficiently manage large amounts of data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing problems THEN the system SHALL support bulk problem import via JSON/CSV formats
2. WHEN displaying large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement pagination for problems and submissions
3. WHEN APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL maintain mock mode for Judge0/JPlag during testing
4. WHEN managing data THEN the system SHALL preserve existing website UI structure while adding functionality
