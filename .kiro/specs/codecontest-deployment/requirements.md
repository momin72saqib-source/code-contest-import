# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for deploying and configuring the CodeContest Pro platform, a production-ready full-stack coding contest system. The platform includes real-time leaderboards, multi-language code execution, problem/test case management, and plagiarism detection via JPlag. The deployment must be fully functional on Replit with proper database integration and external service configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to set up a MongoDB database cluster with proper collections and security configuration, so that the platform can store and manage user data, contests, problems, and submissions securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the database THEN the system SHALL create a MongoDB cluster with the required collections: `users`, `contests`, `problems`, `submissions`
2. WHEN configuring database access THEN the system SHALL whitelist appropriate IP addresses (0.0.0.0/0 for development/testing)
3. WHEN the database is configured THEN the system SHALL provide a valid MONGO_URI connection string
4. IF the database connection fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to mock mode for development

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to configure all required environment variables and secrets in Replit, so that the platform can authenticate users, execute code, and detect plagiarism properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring environment variables THEN the system SHALL require MONGO_URI as a mandatory secret
2. WHEN configuring environment variables THEN the system SHALL require JWT_SECRET as a mandatory secret
3. WHEN generating JWT_SECRET THEN the system SHALL use a cryptographically secure 64-byte random string
4. WHEN configuring optional services THEN the system SHALL accept JUDGE0_API_KEY for code execution
5. WHEN configuring optional services THEN the system SHALL accept JPLAG_API_KEY for plagiarism detection
6. IF optional API keys are missing THEN the system SHALL operate in mock mode for those services

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to deploy both frontend and backend services simultaneously on Replit, so that the complete platform is accessible and functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the platform THEN the system SHALL install all frontend dependencies using npm install
2. WHEN deploying the platform THEN the system SHALL install all backend dependencies using npm install in the backend directory
3. WHEN starting services THEN the system SHALL run the backend on port 3001
4. WHEN starting services THEN the system SHALL run the frontend on port 5000
5. WHEN services are running THEN both frontend and backend SHALL be accessible via their respective ports
6. WHEN using the .replit configuration THEN the system SHALL start both services simultaneously in parallel mode

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student user, I want to register, login, join contests, and submit code solutions, so that I can participate in coding competitions and see my results on real-time leaderboards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL provide user registration functionality
2. WHEN a student registers THEN the system SHALL authenticate them using JWT tokens
3. WHEN a student logs in THEN the system SHALL provide access to available contests
4. WHEN a student joins a contest THEN the system SHALL allow them to view and solve problems
5. WHEN a student submits code THEN the system SHALL execute the code and provide results
6. WHEN submissions are processed THEN the system SHALL update real-time leaderboards
7. WHEN viewing leaderboards THEN the system SHALL display current rankings and scores

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a teacher user, I want to create and manage contests, add problems with test cases, and perform plagiarism detection, so that I can conduct fair and secure coding competitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a teacher accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL provide contest creation functionality
2. WHEN a teacher creates a contest THEN the system SHALL allow adding problems with test cases
3. WHEN a teacher manages problems THEN the system SHALL support multiple programming languages
4. WHEN a teacher reviews submissions THEN the system SHALL provide plagiarism detection capabilities
5. WHEN plagiarism detection runs THEN the system SHALL analyze code similarity using JPlag
6. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display user, contest, and platform statistics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want the system to handle multi-language code execution securely and efficiently, so that students can submit solutions in their preferred programming languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is submitted THEN the system SHALL support Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript execution
2. WHEN using Judge0 API THEN the system SHALL execute code securely in sandboxed environments
3. WHEN Judge0 API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to mock execution mode
4. WHEN code execution completes THEN the system SHALL return results, output, and error messages
5. WHEN processing submissions THEN the system SHALL validate code against provided test cases

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the system to provide real-time updates and analytics, so that I can monitor contest progress and performance metrics live.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN contests are active THEN the system SHALL provide real-time leaderboard updates via WebSocket
2. WHEN submissions are processed THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates to connected clients
3. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive platform statistics
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track user engagement and contest metrics
5. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show real-time contest status and progress

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive verification and testing procedures, so that I can ensure all platform features work correctly before production use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verification begins THEN the system SHALL test user registration and login functionality
2. WHEN testing contests THEN the system SHALL verify contest creation, joining, and problem management
3. WHEN testing submissions THEN the system SHALL verify code submission in multiple languages
4. WHEN testing real-time features THEN the system SHALL verify leaderboard updates work correctly
5. WHEN testing plagiarism detection THEN the system SHALL verify JPlag integration functions properly
6. WHEN testing analytics THEN the system SHALL verify dashboard shows accurate user, contest, and platform stats
7. IF any verification fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance
