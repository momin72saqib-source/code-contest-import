  - Ensure both services start simultaneously and remain stable
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6_

- [x] 6. Verify authentication system functionality


  - Test user registration endpoint with password hashing
  - Test user login endpoint with JWT token generation
  - Verify JWT token validation on protected routes
  - Test authentication middleware on all secured endpoints
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 5.1_

- [x] 7. Test contest and problem management features


  - Verify contest creation functionality for teacher users
  - Test problem addition and management within contests
  - Verify student contest joining and participation flow
  - Test problem viewing and submission interface functionality
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 8. Configure and test code execution system


  - Verify Judge0 API integration falls back to mock mode (no API key provided)
  - Test code submission processing with mock execution engine
  - Verify multi-language support (Python, Java, C++, JavaScript)
  - Test test case evaluation and scoring system
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [x] 9. Set up and test plagiarism detection


  - Configure JPlag API integration with provided API key
